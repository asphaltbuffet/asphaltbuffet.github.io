      <description>I learned about Mermaid in 2021 while trying to find a way to better see changes in diagrams at work. Being able to look through a revision history of images was tolerable, but only slightly better than the proverbial needle and the unexplained presense of a nearby haystack.
But Mermaid resolves my complaints by rendering text/code into fairly nice-looking diagrams and visualizations. Some are too plain for my liking (looking at you state diagram), but they convey information graphically.</description>
